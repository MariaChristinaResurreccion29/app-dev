*Day has a vision impairment and we’re seeing how he has to accept his current situation and adapt. His family is worried about him and are in sense walking on eggshells around him. Mhok is trying to choose a different path from what he knows after coping with the loss of his sister.*

*The show does a really good job by representing how ableism in society affects and invalidates someone with an impairment and their feelings. We see how Mhok is helping Day find joy in his life again without feeling like he’s not allowed to continue to do everything he did before his accident. But more importantly we see how Day is opening Mhok up to being more understanding and educated on what it’s like for someone who has a visual impairment.
The way this show portrays someone adjusting to losing their sight is well done but also, they did a good job at showing the way someone who is able to see should treat someone with a visual impairment.*

*This show does a really great job of showcasing many other prevalent themes in society such as single parents and family dynamics after a life altering accident.*

*The way Sea portrays Days character is commendable and definitely one of the best performances that I’ve seen in any drama. And I can’t even explain the hurt and agony my heart felt watching Jimmy portrays Mhok. Just truly such a beautiful and well done show.
Ofcourse Mark is outstanding with his character Night and hands down his best performance in any drama he’s been in.
Honestly though my favorite part about the show has got to be the way it’s shot. Not only cinematography wise but directional as well.*
